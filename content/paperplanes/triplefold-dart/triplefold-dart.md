|Step|Image|Instruction|
|:-|:-|:------|
|0| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail000.webp" fullimg="step000.webp" >}} | Take a rectangular sheet of paper. |
|1| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail001.webp" fullimg="step001.webp" >}} | Fold it in half along the longer edge. |
|2| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail002.webp" fullimg="step002.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|3| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail003.webp" fullimg="step003.webp" >}} | Make a fold so that the right edge touches the central crease. |
|4| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail004.webp" fullimg="step004.webp" >}} | Fold the left edge so that it touches the central crease as well. |
|5| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail005.webp" fullimg="step005.webp" >}} | Pick up the top right corner and make a diagonal fold such that the top edge touches the central crease. |
|6| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail006.webp" fullimg="step006.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold on the left side. |
|7| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail007.webp" fullimg="step007.webp" >}} | Pick up the angled right edge and fold it such that the angled edge touches the central crease. |
|8| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail008.webp" fullimg="step008.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold on the left side. |
|9| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail009.webp" fullimg="step009.webp" >}} | Pick up the new steeper angled edge on the right side and fold it such that it touches the central crease. |
|10| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail010.webp" fullimg="step010.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold on the left side. |
|11| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail011.webp" fullimg="step011.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|12| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail012.webp" fullimg="step012.webp" >}} | Pick up the left side and make a fold along the central vertical crease. |
|13| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail013.webp" fullimg="step013.webp" >}} | Open it up and use the center layers as fuselage to hold and toss the plane. |

Here is a quick run through of the steps.
