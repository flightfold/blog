|Step|Image|Instruction|
|:-|:-|:------|
|0| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail000.webp" fullimg="step000.webp" >}} | Start with a rectangular piece of paper. |
|1| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail001.webp" fullimg="step001.webp" >}} | Fold it in half along the longer edge. |
|2| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail002.webp" fullimg="step002.webp" >}} | Make a diagonal fold starting from the top right corner to the bottom left corner. |
|3| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail003.webp" fullimg="step003.webp" >}} | Open up all the folds. |
|4| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail004.webp" fullimg="step004.webp" >}} | Pick up the top right corner and make a diagonal fold such that the top edge touches the existing diagonal crease.  |
|5| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail005.webp" fullimg="step005.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold on the left side. |
|6| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail006.webp" fullimg="step006.webp" >}} | Make another diagonal fold, this time starting from the bottom right, making sure the right vertical edge touches the existing diagonal crease. |
|7| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail007.webp" fullimg="step007.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold on the left side. |
|8| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail008.webp" fullimg="step008.webp" >}} | Roll the folded right edge on to itself along the diagonal crease. |
|9| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail009.webp" fullimg="step009.webp" >}} | Repeat it on the other side. |
|10| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail010.webp" fullimg="step010.webp" >}} | Pick up the sharp corner on the top and fold it such that it touches the point where the flaps from left and right meet. |
|11| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail011.webp" fullimg="step011.webp" >}} | Open up the previous fold. |
|12| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail012.webp" fullimg="step012.webp" >}} | Pick up the right side and fold it backwards to align with the left side along the central crease. Make sure the previous folds are exposed. |
|13| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail013.webp" fullimg="step013.webp" >}} | Make a squash fold of the tip by pressing  |
|14| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail014.webp" fullimg="step014.webp" >}} |  |
|15| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail015.webp" fullimg="step015.webp" >}} |  |
