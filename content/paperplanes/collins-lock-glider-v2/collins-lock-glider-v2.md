And here are the detailed, step-by-step instructions. Feel free to refer to the video when it gets harder to follow along. Click on the image thumbnail to see a higher resolution image. 

|Step|Image|Instruction|
|:-|:-|:------|
|0| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail000.webp" fullimg="step000.webp" >}} | Start with a rectangular piece of paper. |
|1| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail001.webp" fullimg="step001.webp" >}} | Pick up the top left corner and make a diagonal fold with the crease starting from the bottom left corner. Unfold. |
|2| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail002.webp" fullimg="step002.webp" >}} | Pick up the bottom left corner and make a diagonal fold similar to the previous step. Unfold. |
|3| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail003.webp" fullimg="step003.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|4| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail004.webp" fullimg="step004.webp" >}} | Fold it in half along the shorter edge creating a horizontal crease. |
|5| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail005.webp" fullimg="step005.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|6| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail006.webp" fullimg="step006.webp" >}} | Flip the paper again. |
|7| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail007.webp" fullimg="step007.webp" >}} | Pick up the left edge and make a fold such that the edge passes through the intersection point of the two diagonal creases. Unfold. |
|8| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail008.webp" fullimg="step008.webp" >}} | Fold the paper such that the intersection point of the newly created crease and the horizontal crease touches the point of intersection of the two diagonal creases. This will create a new parallel crease between the crease created in the previous step  and the intersection point of the two diagonal creases.  |
|9| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail009.webp" fullimg="step009.webp" >}} | The previous step leaves a small strip on the left. Tuck that strip backwards. Check out the video starting at 3:10 min for detailed instructions. |
|10| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail010.webp" fullimg="step010.webp" >}} | Pick up the top left corner and make a diagonal fold such that the left edge aligns with the central horizontal crease. |
|11| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail011.webp" fullimg="step011.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold for the bottom left corner. |
|12| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail012.webp" fullimg="step012.webp" >}} | Following the central horizontal crease make a mountain fold. |
|13| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail013.webp" fullimg="step013.webp" >}} | Open up the flap. Check out the video at 5:00 min to follow along visually. |
|14| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail014.webp" fullimg="step014.webp" >}} | Flip the paper and open the flap on the other side. |
|15| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail015.webp" fullimg="step015.webp" >}} | Unfold the top flap. |
|16| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail016.webp" fullimg="step016.webp" >}} | Make an additional crease on the top flap such that the edge aligns with the crease the top flap exposed. |
|17| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail017.webp" fullimg="step017.webp" >}} | Fold it again along the crease we aligned with in the previous step. |
|18| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail018.webp" fullimg="step018.webp" >}} | Flip the paper to repeat steps 13-17 on the other side. |
|19| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail019.webp" fullimg="step019.webp" >}} | Open up the top flap and make an additional crease such that the edge of the top flap aligns with the crease that just got exposed with opening up the top flap. |
|20| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail020.webp" fullimg="step020.webp" >}} | Fold it along the crease from the top flap. |
|21| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail021.webp" fullimg="step021.webp" >}} | Lets fold the wings. Pick up the top layer and make a fold starting from the point where the first layer of the nose ends (on the left) to meet the crease in the base edge. |
|22| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail022.webp" fullimg="step022.webp" >}} | Flip the paper to fold the wing on the other side by making it match the wing we just folded.  |
|23| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail023.webp" fullimg="step023.webp" >}} | Create a stabilizer by folding 1cm towards the base edge. Make sure the crease is parallel to the base edge. |
|24| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail024.webp" fullimg="step024.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|25| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail025.webp" fullimg="step025.webp" >}} |  Create the stabilizer on the other side. |

Here is a quick run through of the steps.
