|0| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail000.webp" fullimg="step000.webp" >}} | Start with a rectangular piece of paper. |
|1| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail001.webp" fullimg="step001.webp" >}} | Fold it in half along the shorter edge. |
|2| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail002.webp" fullimg="step002.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|3| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail003.webp" fullimg="step003.webp" >}} | Fold the bottom section in half. |
|4| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail004.webp" fullimg="step004.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|5| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail005.webp" fullimg="step005.webp" >}} | Fold the bottom 1/4 th section in half. |
|6| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail006.webp" fullimg="step006.webp" >}} | Fold the paper in half along the longer edge. |
|7| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail007.webp" fullimg="step007.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|8| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail008.webp" fullimg="step008.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|9| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail009.webp" fullimg="step009.webp" >}} | Pick up the bottom right corner and make a diagonal fold starting from the top right corner and ending at the middle of the bottom edge. |
|10| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail010.webp" fullimg="step010.webp" >}} | Unfold. Repeat the fold on the left side. |
|11| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail011.webp" fullimg="step011.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|12| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail012.webp" fullimg="step012.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|13| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail013.webp" fullimg="step013.webp" >}} | Fold it in half following the central valley crease and the diagonal mountain creases. |
|14| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail014.webp" fullimg="step014.webp" >}} | Open up the flap on the top layer and fold it equally on both sides. |
|15| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail015.webp" fullimg="step015.webp" >}} | Open up the top layer. |
|16| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail016.webp" fullimg="step016.webp" >}} | Fold it such that the edge on the left aligns with the crease exposed in the previous step. |
|17| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail017.webp" fullimg="step017.webp" >}} | Fold back the top layer along the original crease. |
|18| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail018.webp" fullimg="step018.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|19| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail019.webp" fullimg="step019.webp" >}} | Open up the top layer. |
|20| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail020.webp" fullimg="step020.webp" >}} | Fold it such that the edge on the right aligns with the crease exposed in the previous step. |
|21| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail021.webp" fullimg="step021.webp" >}} | Fold back the top layer along the original crease. |
|22| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail022.webp" fullimg="step022.webp" >}} | Make the wing by folding the top layer starting from the flap on the nose and making a crease parallel to the bottom edge. |
|23| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail023.webp" fullimg="step023.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|24| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail024.webp" fullimg="step024.webp" >}} | Fold the other wing making it align with the previous fold. |
|25| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail025.webp" fullimg="step025.webp" >}} | Fold the stabilizer by creating a crease 3cm from the wing tip. |
|26| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail026.webp" fullimg="step026.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|27| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail027.webp" fullimg="step027.webp" >}} | Fold the stabilizer on the other side. |
|28| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail028.webp" fullimg="step028.webp" >}} | Open up the wings so that they lie on a single plane and the set the stabilizers perpendicular to the wing. |

Here is a quick run through of the steps.
