|Step|Image|Instruction|
|:-|:-|:------|
|1| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail000.webp" fullimg="step000.webp" >}} | Take a rectangular piece of paper. |
|2| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail001.webp" fullimg="step001.webp" >}} | Make a diagonal fold starting from the left bottom corner. |
|3| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail002.webp" fullimg="step002.webp" >}} | Unfold |
|4| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail003.webp" fullimg="step003.webp" >}} | Repeat the diagonal fold on the other side. |
|5| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail004.webp" fullimg="step004.webp" >}} | Unfold |
|6| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail005.webp" fullimg="step005.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|7| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail006.webp" fullimg="step006.webp" >}} | Create a central crease along the shorter edge by taking the bottom horizontal edge to touch the top edge and then,  unfold. |
|8| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail007.webp" fullimg="step007.webp" >}} | Pick up the left edge and fold it so that it touches the intersection point of the diagonal folds. |
|9| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail008.webp" fullimg="step008.webp" >}} | Pick up the new edge on the left and make one more fold, on to itself, thereby making the size of the strip to half the original size. |
|10| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail009.webp" fullimg="step009.webp" >}} | Pick up the new edge on the left and make a fold towards the right. |
|11| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail010.webp" fullimg="step010.webp" >}} | This is a complex fold. Pick up the paper, unfold the last fold slightly and fold it along the horizontal crease so that the previous fold sticks out. Watching the video might help understanding this better. Start at 2:35 seconds. |
|12| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail011.webp" fullimg="step011.webp" >}} | Open up and flatten the fold on both sides. |
|13| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail012.webp" fullimg="step012.webp" >}} | Open the top flap, fold the bottom left corner so that the bottom edge aligns with the valley crease inside. |
|14| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail013.webp" fullimg="step013.webp" >}} | Fold the new flap on the bottom left, along the valley crease. |
|15| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail014.webp" fullimg="step014.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|16| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail015.webp" fullimg="step015.webp" >}} | Repeat the folds on this side. Open up the flap and fold the top left corner, so that the top edge aligns with the valley crease. |
|17| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail016.webp" fullimg="step016.webp" >}} | Fold the new flap on the top left, along the valley crease. |
|18| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail017.webp" fullimg="step017.webp" >}} | Let us fold the wings. Turn the paper 90 degrees clockwise. Pick up the top flap and fold it downwards, making a parallel crease 1-1.5cm above the bottom edge. |
|19| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail018.webp" fullimg="step018.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|20| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail019.webp" fullimg="step019.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold for the other wing making sure the fold aligns with the wing on the other side. |
|21| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail020.webp" fullimg="step020.webp" >}} | To create a stabilizer, pick up the bottom edge and make a 1cm fold towards the center of the wing.  |
|22| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail021.webp" fullimg="step021.webp" >}} | Match the fold on the other wing. |
|23| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail022.webp" fullimg="step022.webp" >}} | Unfold the wings so that they look like a flat plane. Unfold the stabilizers so that they are perpendicular to the wing planes. |
