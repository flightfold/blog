|Step|Image|Instruction|
|:-|:-|:------|
|0| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail000.webp" fullimg="step000.webp" >}} | Start with a rectangular piece of paper. |
|1| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail001.webp" fullimg="step001.webp" >}} | Pick up the top right corner and make a diagonal fold. |
|2| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail002.webp" fullimg="step002.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|3| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail003.webp" fullimg="step003.webp" >}} | Pick up the top left corner and make a diagonal fold on the opposite side. |
|4| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail004.webp" fullimg="step004.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|5| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail005.webp" fullimg="step005.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|6| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail006.webp" fullimg="step006.webp" >}} | Fold the paper in half along the longer edge. |
|7| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail007.webp" fullimg="step007.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|8| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail008.webp" fullimg="step008.webp" >}} | Make a horizontal crease by folding the top edge such that the top edge touches the intersection point of the diagonal creases. |
|9| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail009.webp" fullimg="step009.webp" >}} | Pick up the newly formed top horizontal edge and fold it in half. |
|10| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail010.webp" fullimg="step010.webp" >}} | Roll the top horizontal edge one more time to create a new fold. |
|11| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail011.webp" fullimg="step011.webp" >}} | Fold the paper in half along the middle vertical valley fold, while also following the two diagonal mountain folds. While doing this make sure the flap on the top is sticking out. Rotate the paper 90 degrees anti-clockwise to get the shape shown in this step.  |
|12| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail012.webp" fullimg="step012.webp" >}} | Pick up the flap on the bottom and unfold it. Make sure you do it on both sides so that the unfolded flap looks equal on both sides. |
|13| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail013.webp" fullimg="step013.webp" >}} | Open up the top layer. |
|14| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail014.webp" fullimg="step014.webp" >}} | Make a fold such that the bottom left edge (along the nose) aligns with the crease that got exposed by opening the top layer. |
|15| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail015.webp" fullimg="step015.webp" >}} | Fold the top left layer back along the existing crease. |
|16| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail016.webp" fullimg="step016.webp" >}} | Flip the paper and repeat the steps on the other side. |
|17| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail017.webp" fullimg="step017.webp" >}} | Open up the top layer. |
|18| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail018.webp" fullimg="step018.webp" >}} | Make a fold such that the bottom right edge (along the nose) aligns with the crease that got exposed by opening the top layer. |
|19| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail019.webp" fullimg="step019.webp" >}} | Fold the top left layer back along the existing crease. |
|20| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail020.webp" fullimg="step020.webp" >}} | Fold the wing by starting at the nose and forming a crease such that it touches the central crease on the other end. |
|21| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail021.webp" fullimg="step021.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|22| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail022.webp" fullimg="step022.webp" >}} | Fold the wing matching the other side. |
|23| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail023.webp" fullimg="step023.webp" >}} | Create the stabilizer by folding a small section of the wing towards the nose. Make sure the fold is parallel to the bottom crease.|
|24| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail024.webp" fullimg="step024.webp" >}} | Repeat the stabilizer fold on the other wing. |
|25| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail025.webp" fullimg="step025.webp" >}} | Open up the wings so that they form a single plane and the stabilizers are perpendicular to the wing. |

Here is a quick run through of the steps.
