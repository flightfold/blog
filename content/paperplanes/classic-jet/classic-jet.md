|Step|Image|Instruction|
|:-|:-|:------|
|0| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail000.webp" fullimg="step000.webp" >}} | Take a rectangular piece of paper. |
|1| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail001.webp" fullimg="step001.webp" >}} | Fold it in half along the shorter edge. |
|2| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail002.webp" fullimg="step002.webp" >}} | Unfold |
|3| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail003.webp" fullimg="step003.webp" >}} | Pick up the top right corner and make a diagonal fold so that the left edge aligns with the central crease. |
|4| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail004.webp" fullimg="step004.webp" >}} | Repeat it on the other side. |
|5| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail005.webp" fullimg="step005.webp" >}} | Pick up the top left diagonal edge and fold it again so that the edge touches the central crease. |
|6| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail006.webp" fullimg="step006.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold on the bottom left edge. |
|7| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail007.webp" fullimg="step007.webp" >}} | Pick up the new bottom left edge and fold it so that it aligns with the top left edge. |
|8| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail008.webp" fullimg="step008.webp" >}} | Fold the top flap towards the bottom, forming an crease parallel to the bottom edge and width of 1cm. |
|9| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail009.webp" fullimg="step009.webp" >}} | Flip the paper and repeat the steps on the other side. |
|10| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail010.webp" fullimg="step010.webp" >}} | To form the stabilizers, fold two centers from the top flap towards the center, making a crease parallel to the bottom edge. |
|11| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail011.webp" fullimg="step011.webp" >}} | Flip the paper and repeat the steps on the other side. |
|12| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail012.webp" fullimg="step012.webp" >}} | Now open up both the wings such that they form a continuous plane. |
|13| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail013.webp" fullimg="step013.webp" >}} | Unfold the stabilizers at the ends of the wings such that they are perpendicular to the wings. |


Here is a quick run through of the steps.
