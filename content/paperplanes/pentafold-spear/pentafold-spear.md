|Step|Image|Instruction|
|:-|:-|:------|
|0| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail000.webp" fullimg="step000.webp" >}} | Start with a rectangular piece of paper. |
|1| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail001.webp" fullimg="step001.webp" >}} | Fold it in half along the shorter edge. |
|2| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail002.webp" fullimg="step002.webp" >}} | Unfold. |
|3| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail003.webp" fullimg="step003.webp" >}} | Pick up the top left corner and make a diagonal fold such that the left edge aligns with the horizontal crease. |
|4| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail004.webp" fullimg="step004.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold for the bottom left corner. |
|5| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail005.webp" fullimg="step005.webp" >}} | Unfold the previous two folds. |
|6| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail006.webp" fullimg="step006.webp" >}} | Pick up the top left corner and make a fold so that the left edge coincides with the crease we created in the previous step. |
|7| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail007.webp" fullimg="step007.webp" >}} | Repeat the previous step for the bottom left corner. |
|8| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail008.webp" fullimg="step008.webp" >}} | Pick up the angled edge we just folded and fold it again along the crease we just made. Repeat it for the bottom side as well. |
|9| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail009.webp" fullimg="step009.webp" >}} | Pick up the new angled edge on the top left corner and make a fold so that the edge coincides with the central horizontal crease. |
|10| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail010.webp" fullimg="step010.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold for the bottom left edge as well. |
|11| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail011.webp" fullimg="step011.webp" >}} | Similar to step 9, pick up the angled edge and make a fold so that it coincides with the central horizontal crease. |
|12| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail012.webp" fullimg="step012.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold for the bottom left edge as well. |
|13| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail013.webp" fullimg="step013.webp" >}} | Make another fold similar to step 9 and 11. |
|14| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail014.webp" fullimg="step014.webp" >}} | Repeat the fold on the other side. |
|15| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail015.webp" fullimg="step015.webp" >}} | Flip the paper. |
|16| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail016.webp" fullimg="step016.webp" >}} | Fold it in half along the horizontal crease. |
|17| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail017.webp" fullimg="step017.webp" >}} | Pick up the top flap and fold it downwards, such that the crease starts at the middle and ends at the point where the top layer ends. Note that the newly created crease will not be parallel to the bottom edge.  |
|18| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail018.webp" fullimg="step018.webp" >}} | Flip the paper and make a crease identical to the one we just folded on this side. |
|19| {{< popout path="../frames/" thumbnail="thumbnail019.webp" fullimg="step019.webp" >}} | Open up both the wings and set them such that the wings are along the same plane. |

Here is a quick run through of the steps.
